# Shooting Gallery

Click the targets to score points before they disappear. You get more points for higher accuracy. The higher your score, the faster the targets. If a target disappears before you click it, you get a miss. The game ends after 5 misses.

Made with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org "LÖVE - Free 2D Game Engine") and [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump "Helper Utilities for a Multitude of Problems").

Currently using [Kenney assets](https://www.kenney.nl/assets), with thanks.
